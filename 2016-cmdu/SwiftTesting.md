# [fit] Workflow

![](workflow.png)

---

# [fit] Testing!

---

# [fit] Too
# [fit] difficult

---

# [fit] Not enough
# [fit] time

---

# [fit] Too
# [fit] busy

---

# [fit] Too lazy
# [fit] `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

---

# [fit] Make
# [fit] it easy!

---

# [fit] … without
# [fit] diminishing
# [fit] quality of code.

---

# [fit] … maybe even
# [fit] improving
# [fit] quality of code!

---

# [fit] View
# [fit] Models

---

# [fit] Protocols

---

# [fit] :swimmer:

---

# Recap

* View models keep view controllers slim.
* View models make it easier to test (some) UI without UI tests.
* Protocols allow for real decoupling.
* Protocols make it easier to write and change tests. (Less coupling and dependencies!)

---

# [fit] Lazy (but
# [fit] thorough) tests
# ⇔
# [fit] Modular app code
